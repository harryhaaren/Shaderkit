/**
 * Render pass represents one renderable image that might only be a small part
 * of the whole composition. Different kinds of render passes could be for
 * example shadow map rendering, gaussian blur post-processing and normal phong
 * shading.
 *
 * Render pass might use outputs (textures) of other render passes as inputs
 * to shaders, and the output generated from this render pass might be either
 * the final output to screen or an intermediate result, rendered to texture
 * with Frame Buffer Object.
 *
 * Currently one render pass can have exactly one shader program and one Camera
 * (or more generally "viewport"). It also has list of objects, lights and
 * in/out textures.
 *
 * Render passes are controlled by Scene, the Pass itself doesn't know of any
 * other passes.
 *
 * @todo implement that stuff ^
